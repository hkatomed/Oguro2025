This dataset contains two parts.

data: Directories for running REFINE and analyzing degenerated GUCG motifs
scripts: Scripts for the above analysis

Note: REFINE was obtained from Riordan et al. NAR 39(4) 1501-1509, 2011 (PMID: 20959291), and modifed to fit our environment. It requires some tools as explained in README.txt in the running directories.

In order to run REFINE and summarize data, commands in 20240918_scREFINE_1.sh and 20240918_scREFINE_2.R were executed.
For the analysis of degenerated GUCG motifs, commands in 20240918_GUCG_degenerated_1.R were executed.
To analyze the motif hits per gene basis, commands in CDSlen_scripts were executed.
For motif distribution analysis, commands in motifDistribution_scripts were executed.
For read length analysis, length_start_top50.pl, made by Yuanhui, was used.
To analyze motif enrichment, scripts in motifHits were executed.
